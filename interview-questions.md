# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: Ruby hashes deal heavy with key-value pairs and are almost in the same boat as arrays, but the indexing is a little different in that it's more about the kind of objects one is dealing with vs. the numerical order of the index - this is because Ruby is an object-oriented programming language and not based in functional programming. 

Researched answer: Hashes are a type of data structure that hold items based on their associated keys. This is similar to arrays but different in that arrays store data from an ordered index. Key-value pairs with Ruby hashes come from data entries creating a representation of data that is centered around association. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is like a package of data or patch install like pieces of information that are uploaded by members/contributors of the Ruby community to be used within the Ruby environment to improve certain tasks or make a particular matter easier. For example with Ruby on Rails, when one wants to use `rspec` they can check the Ruby Gems site to see what the latest contribution is in regarding `rspec` and ensure they're using the most up-to-date version. 

Researched answer: A gem is short for RubyGems, which is a package manager for Ruby libraries. Gems are used to carry out installs, removals, or updatess when it comes to Ruby libraries or environment. Ruby has a large community backing it that often relies on its contributors for these gems  that provide numerous functionalities to the large number of libraries within the Ruby ecosystem. Gems natively are a default package manger within Ruby since Ruby v1.9. The most known example of a gem is Ruby on Rails - the web apllication framework used for website creation and other related services. 

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a Ruby gem used as web application framework. It uses a community driven tools like `rspec` that effects how Ruby testing is conducted thru Ruby on Rails. 

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application development framework for Ruby that simplies the creation of web application and similar services. It is one of the most widely known RubyGems and is often used with 'Rspec' which a behavioral-based unit test framework when one is working within the Ruby ecosystem. 


4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: Relational databases are similar to relational operators in that it is centered around comparing or showing the comparative relationship between the given data. In other words, a relational database is a database that stores information in a table based on the relation the information in one block or row has with another. But yes, there are other types of databases that list out or hold information based on other parameters depending on the needs of the project. 

Researched answer: A `relational database` is a kind of database that holds and gives access to specific points of data that are related to one another; in other words, it organizes the inserted data through use of a comparison type algorithmn/mechanism. There are various other types of databases, a few examples might be: `object-oriented databases` (represented in the form of objects), `NoSQL` (also known as nonrelational databases, are essentially the opposite of relational databases and are more complex because they allow unstructured and semi-structured data to be stored and manipulated), `cloud databases` (databases that are built, deployed, and accessed through a cloud environment - can be private, public, or a hybrid of the two), or `self-driving databases` (also known as autonomous databases, are the newest type available today - are cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, other routine tasks traditionally done by a database admin). 

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are used within databases to help  identify and differentiate between certain pieces of information. They are important because they organize data and make it easier to locate, update, or delete information within a database. 

Researched answer: Primary keys are a field within a table that uniquely identify each row or record in a database table. These unique identifiers are important because they make searching data, updating, or delete said information within a database table more efficient. Without the unique ID factor of primary keys organizing and locating data within a relational database wouuld be nearly impossible. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REST stands for Representational State Transfer - is a set of standards used in many programming languages to create efficient and reusable routes; the goal of these routes is to map HTTP methos and CRUD actions together in a conventional pattern in hopes that the users' URL navigation experience is clean & consistent. 

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation - a text format for storing and transfering data by using human-readable text.  

3. ERB: provides an easy to use but powerful templating mechanism to Ruby where the code can b added to any plan text document for the purposes of generating document information details. 

4. Params: an alias for the parameters method in Ruby Rails - refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request. 

5. API: the way you interact with a programming library, that defines how you ask for something and how you set something
